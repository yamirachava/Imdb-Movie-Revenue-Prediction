# IMDb Movie Revenue Prediction
This project analyzes relationships between movie budgets, genres, and box office revenue using Python and historical data. It applies exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and regression modeling to assess genre performance and generate data-driven insights for production and budgeting decisions.

Objective
- Evaluate how production budgets and genres influence box office revenue  
- Identify genres that demonstrate strong financial performance despite lower budgets  
- Build interpretable regression models for revenue forecasting

Data & Methodology
- **Dataset:** IMDb movie dataset  
- **Tools:** Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels)  
- **Techniques Used:**
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing  
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
  - Feature engineering (genre encoding, crew size extraction)  
  - Correlation analysis for feature selection  
  - Multiple linear regression modeling

Key Insights
- Production budget is a strong revenue driver but not the sole determinant  
- Certain genres exhibit higher revenue efficiency relative to budget  
- Genre effects vary significantly when controlling for budget and score  
- Regression models offer interpretability but have limitations with extreme outliers
